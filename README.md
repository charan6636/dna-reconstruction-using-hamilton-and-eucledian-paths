# dna-reconstruction-using-hamilton-and-eucledian-paths
Reconstructing the original genome by utilizing a Hamiltonian path approach to maximize the weight of the Hamiltonian path. Implementing this approach to reconstruct the original genome sequence.
Also Implementing the above approach using the Eulerian path approach.
